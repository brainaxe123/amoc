I have utlized whatever knowledge I have and this project still needs a lot of improvement. This project basically helps to find malware Portable Executable files.
Hpw to use-
Download both the above files.
Run testing.py in your terminal and provide the storage address of the pe file to be scanned.
This will return an array with 16 values.
Put this array as input in the Machine Learning Model which will tell whether the filw is legitimate or a malware one.
