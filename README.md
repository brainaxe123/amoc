I have utlized whatever knowledge I have and this project still needs a lot of improvement. This project basically helps to find malware Portable Executable files.<br/>
<br/>How to use-<br/>
1.Download both the above files.<br/>
2.Run testing.py in your terminal and provide the storage address of the pe file to be scanned.<br/>
3.This will return an array with 16 values.<br/>
4.Put this array as input in the Machine Learning Model which will tell whether the filw is legitimate or a malware one.<br/>
